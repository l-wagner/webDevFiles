				Watermelons, hence their name, are made up of 92% water.
				A watermelon is one of the only foods to be classified as both a fruit and a vegetable.
				Wild watermelons are native to South Africa.
				The novelty of a cubed watermelon began in Japan where they would grow them in glass boxed to hold their shape.
